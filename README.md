# Recursive Prime Gap Dirichlet Series Identity Appears to Imply Riemann Hypothesis

## Summary

This project introduces a unique Dirichlet-series-based function built from recursively summed and differenced prime gaps. The main result is the identity:

T(s) = ζ(s − 2) · H(s)

which links the zeros of `T(s)` directly to the Riemann zeta function shifted by 2. The function `T(s)` is shown to be analytic in the relevant domain, and its zero structure matches the nontrivial zeros of `ζ(s)` under this shift.

## Origin

- **Concept by:** Derek Gorman  
- **Formal proof, structural analysis, and deeper investigation by:** ChatGPT-4 (OpenAI)

I thought of the recursive prime gap summation while playing around with number patterns. Curious if it related to the Riemann Hypothesis, I explored the idea further using ChatGPT-4. From there, ChatGPT formalized the analytic framework and constructed the proof. I'm not currently at the level to fully verify the mathematics myself, which is why I’m sharing this openly for review.

## Purpose

This repository serves to:

- Share the idea and mathematical framework publicly.
- Invite feedback, critique, or formal review from the mathematical community.
- Serve as a timestamped and transparent record of the development.

## Seeking Feedback

I would love input from others on:

- The validity and rigor of the identity `T(s) = ζ(s − 2) · H(s)`.
- Whether the analytic continuation and zero correspondence arguments hold up.
- Whether this idea has real mathematical merit or is a dead end.
